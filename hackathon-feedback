Pika Jump Game
Great job with your project!
Its cool to see your progress after weeks of learning JS.
I really like the game and it is done well.
You did not use any unnesessary code and made it simple and working!
You  used conditionals, dom manipulation, functions... 10/10
I would add something small , a counter that counts how many pokeballs you jumped over. 
Maybe also a high score !
Great job again. Keep at it!
